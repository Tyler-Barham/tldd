To compile tldd you need a C++11 compiler, e.g. GCC 4.7 or Clang 3.x, and my
Pstreams library.

If you have Pstreams 0.8.0 or later installed then to compile tldd just run:

    make

Otherwise run:

    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/pstreams/code pstreams
    make CPPFLAGS=-I.

To install it just copy it somewhere nice, or to install it along with
a man page run:

    make install

or:

    make install PREFIX=$HOME
