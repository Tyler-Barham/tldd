TLDD
----

A program similar to [ldd(1)][ldd] but showing the output as a tree, so you can
see where a particular dependency comes from.

Requires a C++11 compiler and the header `pstream.h` from
http://pstreams.sf.net/ (see the `INSTALL` file for more information).


[ldd]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html
